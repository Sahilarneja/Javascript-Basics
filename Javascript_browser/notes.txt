CHAPTER-6
html - skeleton
css - styling
js - Logic
javascript was initially created to make webpages alive
- the browser has an embedded engine called javascript engine or the javascript
runtime 


# Developer tools
every browser has some developer tools which makes a developer's life a lot 
easier
(f12 on chrome opens dev tools)

1) Elements -- All html Elements
2) Console -- All the errors + logs
3) Network -- All network requests
we can also write js commands in the console

##               <Script>
The script tag is used to insert javascript into an html page
-the script tag can be used to insert external or internal scripts
<script>
alert("Hello")
</script>

//or...

<Script src="  .js"></script>
the benefit of a seprate js file is that the browser will download it and
store it in its cache 

<script src=" .js">
console.log()      //THIS WILL BE IGNORED
</script>




Advantages of using script file using src attribute of script tag
1. Sepration of Caching
2. Browser Caching



##           Console object methods
the console object has several methods log being one of them. some of them
are as follows:

assert() -> used to assert a condition
clear() -> clears the console
error() -> specify error
log() -> outputs a message to the console

table() -> Displays a tabular data
ex: 
obj={a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
console.table(obj) //this will create a table

warn() -> used for warnings
ex: 
console.warn("Hey please.....")

info() -> used for special information
console.info("Hey.....")

time() -- to start a timer
timeEnd() -- to end timer and know time of a particular code 


------------ALERT/PROMPT/CONFIRM
ALERT:
used to invake a mini window with a message

             alert("Hello")


Prompt:
used to take user input as string

inp=prompt("hi", "no")   // no here is optional default value


Confirm:
shows a message and waits for the user to process ok or cancel.
returns true for ok and false for cancel

the exact location and look is determined by the browser which is a 
limitation



##  Window object, BOM & DOM
we have the following when javascript runs in a browser

window 
      -DOM (Document object model) 
      DOM represents the page content as html
      -document.body    ->page body as js object
      -document.body.style.background="green"   ->changes page background to
       green

      -BOM (Browser object model)
      the browser object model(BOM) represents additional objects provided
      by the browser (host enviornment) for working with everything except
      the document

      the functions alert/confirm/prompt are also a part of the BOM

      location.href="www.google.com" //redirect to another URL

      -javascript Core

-window object represents Browser window and provides methods to control
it. It is a global object
